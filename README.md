Project Description: Simple Stock Management System (In Progress)

This project aims to develop a straightforward web-based stock management system for basic inventory control needs. It is currently in progress and includes the following features:

Database Structure: Utilizes essential tables like Users, Storekeeper, Products, ProductIn, and ProductOut to manage inventory and user data.

Basic Functionality:

User Authentication: Allows storekeepers to log in with basic username and password credentials. Logout functionality is implemented.
CRUD Operations: Provides basic operations to add, view, update, and delete records for products received (ProductIn) and products distributed (ProductOut).
Reporting: Includes a simple report generation feature to display daily stock status for products received (ProductIn).
User Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, using Bootstrap for basic styling to ensure functionality over aesthetics.

Security Measures: Implements basic security measures such as password hashing for user authentication and input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities.

This project is focused on delivering fundamental inventory management capabilities while maintaining simplicity in design and functionality. It is an ongoing effort with plans to enhance features, improve user interface design, and incorporate additional functionalities based on feedback and project requirements.
